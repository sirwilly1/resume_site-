    Im a software engineer with years of experience producing high quality code and algorithms. My biggest achievements are sending a Cube Satellite into space and working with ARCS lab to work on a self driving robot. I have an extensive background in Machine Vision and Robotics.

    When I'm not programming and building things I enjoy meeting new people. Im not shy when it comes to awkward situations and embrace them. My biggest strengths as an engineer is working on a problem till it's solved. 

    I really do take pride in the things I build no matter how small. My goals as an engineer is to build something that matters to the world and will impact peoples lives in a meaningfully way.
